# Experiment 8: Send and Receive PGP Encrypted Email using Thunderbird

## Objective
Use Thunderbird and PGP to securely send and receive encrypted and digitally signed emails.

## Description
This experiment demonstrates email security through the implementation of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption. Students configure Thunderbird email client with PGP/GPG encryption, generate key pairs, exchange public keys, and send encrypted and digitally signed emails to ensure both confidentiality and authenticity of email communications.

## Key Concepts
- PGP/GPG encryption
- Public key cryptography
- Email encryption and digital signatures
- Key management and distribution
- Confidentiality and authenticity
- End-to-end encryption

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Mozilla Thunderbird email client
- Enigmail or built-in OpenPGP support
- GnuPG (GPG) for key management
- Email accounts for testing

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of email encryption mechanisms
- Ability to generate and manage PGP key pairs
- Knowledge of sending encrypted and signed emails
- Recognition of importance of secure email communication
