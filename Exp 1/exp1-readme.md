# Experiment 1: Implement and Analyze Classical Symmetric Ciphers (Caesar and Vigenère)

## Objective
Understand the working of traditional symmetric key algorithms by implementing Caesar and Vigenère ciphers for encryption and decryption.

## Description
This experiment focuses on classical symmetric encryption techniques that form the foundation of modern cryptography. Students implement two historical ciphers:
- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword to determine the shift for each letter

## Key Concepts
- Symmetric key cryptography
- Substitution ciphers
- Encryption and decryption processes
- Frequency analysis and cipher breaking

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Python/Java/C++ for implementation
- Text editor or IDE

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of basic encryption principles
- Ability to implement encryption and decryption algorithms
- Recognition of vulnerabilities in classical ciphers
- Insights into the evolution of cryptographic techniques
