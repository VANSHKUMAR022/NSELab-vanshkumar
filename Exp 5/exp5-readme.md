# Experiment 5: Capture and Analyze TLS Handshake using Wireshark

## Objective
Use Wireshark to observe and dissect the TLS handshake process during HTTPS communication.

## Description
This experiment provides hands-on experience with network protocol analysis by capturing and examining the TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake. Students use Wireshark to monitor HTTPS traffic and analyze each phase of the TLS handshake including ClientHello, ServerHello, certificate exchange, key exchange, and encrypted communication establishment.

## Key Concepts
- TLS/SSL protocol
- TLS handshake phases
- Certificate verification
- Cipher suite negotiation
- Symmetric and asymmetric key exchange
- Network packet analysis

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Wireshark network analyzer
- Web browser for HTTPS connections
- OpenSSL for testing

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of TLS handshake process
- Ability to capture and analyze network traffic
- Knowledge of secure communication establishment
- Recognition of different TLS versions and cipher suites
