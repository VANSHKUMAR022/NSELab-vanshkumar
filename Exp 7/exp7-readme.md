# Experiment 7: Analyze WPA2 Wireless Security and Capture Handshake with Wireshark

## Objective
Capture and analyze the WPA2 4-way handshake process using Wireshark to understand secure wireless communication.

## Description
This experiment explores wireless network security by analyzing the WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) protocol. Students use Wireshark to capture the 4-way handshake that occurs when a client connects to a WPA2-protected wireless network, understanding how encryption keys are negotiated and established for secure wireless communication.

## Key Concepts
- WPA2 security protocol
- 4-way handshake process
- EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN)
- PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) generation
- Wireless network security
- Packet capture in monitor mode

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Wireshark network analyzer
- Wireless network adapter with monitor mode support
- WPA2-protected access point
- aircrack-ng suite (optional)

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of WPA2 authentication process
- Ability to capture wireless traffic
- Knowledge of 4-way handshake mechanism
- Recognition of wireless security vulnerabilities and protections
