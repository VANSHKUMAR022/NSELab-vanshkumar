# Experiment 3: Simulate User Authentication and Replay Attack Handling (Using Challenge-Response Protocol)

## Objective
Develop a basic challenge-response authentication system to validate user identity and simulate replay attack detection.

## Description
This experiment explores secure authentication mechanisms by implementing a challenge-response protocol. Students create a system where the server sends a random challenge to the client, and the client must respond with a cryptographically correct answer. The experiment also demonstrates how this approach prevents replay attacks.

## Key Concepts
- User authentication protocols
- Challenge-response mechanism
- Replay attack prevention
- Nonce (number used once)
- Cryptographic validation

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Python/Java for protocol implementation
- Socket programming for client-server communication
- Random number generators
- Hash functions for response generation

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of secure authentication methods
- Ability to implement challenge-response protocols
- Recognition of replay attack vulnerabilities
- Knowledge of prevention mechanisms for authentication attacks
