# Experiment 9: Configure and Analyze IPsec VPN in Tunnel Mode

## Objective
Set up an IPsec VPN in tunnel mode and analyze encrypted packet flow to understand secure VPN communication.

## Description
This experiment covers Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology using IPsec protocol. Students configure an IPsec VPN in tunnel mode between two networks or hosts, establish secure encrypted tunnels, and use Wireshark to analyze the encapsulated and encrypted packet flow, understanding how IPsec provides network-level security.

## Key Concepts
- IPsec protocol architecture
- Tunnel mode vs Transport mode
- IKE (Internet Key Exchange) phases
- ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
- AH (Authentication Header)
- VPN security and encryption
- Site-to-site VPN configuration

## Tools/Technologies Used
- StrongSwan or OpenSwan for IPsec
- Linux/Unix systems for VPN endpoints
- Wireshark for packet analysis
- Virtual machines or physical routers

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of IPsec VPN architecture
- Ability to configure tunnel mode VPN
- Knowledge of IKE and ESP protocols
- Skills in analyzing encrypted VPN traffic
