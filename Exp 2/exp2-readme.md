# Experiment 2: Generate SHA-256 Hash and Verify Data Integrity

## Objective
Use hashing techniques to generate and compare SHA-256 hashes to verify data integrity and detect tampering.

## Description
This experiment demonstrates the use of cryptographic hash functions for ensuring data integrity. Students learn to generate SHA-256 hashes for various inputs and understand how even minor changes to data result in completely different hash values, making tampering detection possible.

## Key Concepts
- Cryptographic hash functions
- SHA-256 algorithm
- Data integrity verification
- Hash collision resistance
- One-way functions

## Tools/Technologies Used
- OpenSSL command-line tools
- Python hashlib library
- Online hash generators (for comparison)

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of hash function properties
- Ability to generate and verify SHA-256 hashes
- Recognition of hash functions in security applications
- Knowledge of data tampering detection techniques
