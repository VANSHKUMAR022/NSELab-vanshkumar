# Experiment 10: Setup and Test a Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Snort

## Objective
Learn IDS concepts by installing and configuring Snort, simulating network attacks, and analyzing suspicious traffic alerts.

## Description
This experiment introduces network security monitoring through the implementation of Snort, a popular open-source Intrusion Detection System. Students install and configure Snort, create custom detection rules, simulate various network attacks, and analyze the alerts generated by the IDS to identify malicious activities and security threats.

## Key Concepts
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Network-based vs Host-based IDS
- Signature-based detection
- Snort rule syntax and creation
- Alert analysis and incident response
- Network traffic monitoring
- False positives and tuning

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Snort IDS
- Linux system for Snort installation
- Network traffic generators (hping3, nmap)
- Wireshark for packet verification
- Log analysis tools

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of IDS architecture and operation
- Ability to install and configure Snort
- Knowledge of creating detection rules
- Skills in analyzing security alerts and identifying threats
