# Experiment 4: Generate and Verify X.509 Self-Signed Digital Certificate

## Objective
Create a self-signed X.509 certificate using OpenSSL and inspect its structure and use in secure communications.

## Description
This experiment introduces students to digital certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Using OpenSSL, students generate self-signed X.509 certificates, examine their structure including issuer, subject, validity period, and public key, and understand how certificates establish trust in secure communications.

## Key Concepts
- X.509 certificate standard
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Self-signed vs CA-signed certificates
- Certificate fields (Subject, Issuer, Validity, Public Key)
- Digital signatures and trust chains

## Tools/Technologies Used
- OpenSSL command-line tools
- Certificate viewer tools
- Text editor for configuration files

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of digital certificate structure
- Ability to generate and manage certificates
- Knowledge of certificate-based authentication
- Recognition of PKI role in secure communications
