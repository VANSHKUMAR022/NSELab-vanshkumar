# Experiment 6: Establish Secure Remote Login using SSH

## Objective
Demonstrate secure remote server access using SSH with password and key-based authentication.

## Description
This experiment teaches secure remote access techniques using SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. Students configure SSH servers and clients, establish secure connections using both password and public key authentication methods, and understand the security advantages of SSH over traditional protocols like Telnet.

## Key Concepts
- SSH protocol and architecture
- Password-based authentication
- Public key authentication
- RSA/DSA key pairs
- Secure remote access
- SSH configuration and hardening

## Tools/Technologies Used
- OpenSSH client and server
- ssh-keygen for key generation
- Linux/Unix terminal
- PuTTY (for Windows users)

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of SSH security mechanisms
- Ability to configure SSH servers and clients
- Knowledge of key-based authentication advantages
- Skills in secure remote system administration
